# Axanar Crowd Funding Fulfillment Website

This is the Laravel codebase for https://aresdigital.axanar.com/, a crowd funding fulfillment website for the Star Trek fan film Axanar.  In 2014, Prelude to Axanar, was released, funded by 2 Kickstarter and 1 Indiegogo crowdfunding campaigns. This is a membership fulfillment website for donors to these 3 campaigns.

I have served as the Chief Software Engineer in charge of system administration, web development and customer support since July 2019.
