                                The most common reason for this is that donors are confused as to which fundraiser they have donated to. Please review the donation receipt
                                that you recieved by email at the time that the donation was made and confirm that you have actually donated to the fundraiser that you
                                believe you have.</p>
                            <p>
                                The second most common reason is that a donor has used one email address for one donation and then another email address for a later
                                donation. Since <?= config('app.versionName') ?> only knows of a donation by the email address that was associated with it at the time the donation was
                                made, please check your donation receipt to verify which email address that you've used with each donation and then log in to Ares Digital
                                2.0 with the appropriate email address. If this applies to you then please see the F.A.Q. topic that covers merging multiple accounts in to
                                one for simpler account/donation management.
